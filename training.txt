SCHOOL     This program is housed at Loudoun County High School, 415 Dry Mill Road SW, Leesburg, VA 20175. Students accepted into the program become students at Loudoun County High School and must attend Loudoun County High School on both A and B days. Please note that if accepted, the parent/guardian will be responsible for providing transportation to Loudoun County High School. These applications are for the 2020–2021 school year and are open to eighth-graders at Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) middle schools not assigned to Loudoun County High School. LCPS middle schools covered by this process include: Belmont Ridge, Blue Ridge, Brambleton, Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, Harmony, Harper Park, J. Michael Lunsford, Mercer, River Bend, Seneca Ridge, Smart's Mill, Sterling, Stone Hill, Trailside and Willard Intermediate. There are two phases to the Admissions Process.  There will be Phase I (Application) and Phase II (Interview). 
SCHOOL     Average scores for Asian and White students in LCPS were relatively stable, with only a one- or two-point variation in Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing and Math. Black/African-American students from the class of 2019 scored an average of five points lower in both subjects when compared to Black/African-American students from the class of 2018.  Scores for Hispanic students decreased from 570 to 563 in Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing and from 554 to 549 in Math. LCPS has made closing the “achievement gap” between white and minority students a priority.  Efforts to address those gaps include investing in additional professional development for teachers to meet the needs of English learners and students with disabilities and new instructional facilitators to strengthen teacher teams’ instructional strategies across the school division.
SCHOOL     The College Board also provides a rating of College and Career Readiness based on benchmark scores for Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math. Students who meet the benchmark in each subject have a 75 percent chance of earning at least a “C” in first-semester, college-level courses in that subject. Seventy percent of LCPS’ 2019 graduates met the benchmarks in both content areas, compared to 54 percent of students in Virginia, and 45 percent of students across the nation. LCPS students who designated one or more institutions to receive their score report selected a total of 809 post-secondary schools. The most common in-state institutions were James Madison University (36.8 percent of students); George Mason University (35.2 percent); Virginia Tech (33.5 percent); Virginia Commonwealth University (32.5 percent); and the University of Virginia (28 percent).
