To finish out this month, this week we will share about how you can help your child build a "stress survival kit!" Evidence-based research has suggested that  discussing common problems and developing techniques to deal with stressors can help prevent stress from developing into anxiety and depression (adapted from G.I.R.L.S. Group Counseling Activities for Enhancing Social and Emotional Development). As a trusted adult in your child's life, you can help lead this important discussion with your child and help him/her build a "stress survival kit" using the following steps: 1. Ask your child to talk with you about different stressors in his/her life. You can instruct him/her to brainstorm and write down each different stressor in his/her life on separate index cards. 2. Brainstorm and collaborate with your child to develop a list of ways he/she can help prevent or deal with each of his/her stressors. If you have had him/her write the stressors on index cards, you may have him/her add the coping strategies you have come up with on the opposite of each card. 3. Provide or help your child create a special but accessible place (ie. personal envelope, shoe box, decorated folder, etc.) to keep his/her index cards and coping strategies. This is going to be his/her special stress survival kit to use as a reminder of what to do when a stressor arises. 4. To build on this activity, you may build your own stress survival kit alongside your child and/or share your own stressors and related coping strategies. This may serve as an important relationship-building opportunity and help reaffirm that you are a trusted adult they can come to, talk and relate with about stressors in life. As always, please remind your child that it is okay to reach out for help when they are feeling overwhelmed and need to talk. If you are having concerns about your child please feel free to reach out to your child's counselor for support and additional resources. Renee M.
